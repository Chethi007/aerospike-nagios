* Introduction
ASNagios to simplifies Nagios configurations for Aerospike clusters.
The goal is to reduce the complexity to 3 simple steps.
1. Install Nagios
2. Add cluster details in ASNagios's config.yml
3. Run ASNagios and enjoy

The project is not there yet, there are extra steps not yet automated.
* Features
- Only need to inform ASNagios about a single node in each cluster you wish to
  monitor.
- Can monitor any stat returned by
  - =asinfo -v 'statistics' [-h <HOST>] [-p <XDR_PORT|HOST_PORT>]=
  - =asinfo -v 'namespace/<NAMESPACE NAME>' [-h host]=
- Can monitor changes since the last call (deltas)
- Can monitor aggregations across all node
  - Supported aggregations: min, max, sum
  - Can also monitor the change (delta) since last call.
* Known Issues
- Monitoring changes (deltas) needs to be reworked, results may be wrong.
- Monitoring namespace and xdr stats not yet supported by plugin.
* Getting Started
1. Untar the provided package
2. Install dependencies \\
   =pip install -r requirements.txt=
2. Add your cluster details to the *clusters* sections of configs/config.yml
3. run asnagios.py \\
   =asnagios.py -c configs/config.yml [-o aerospike/]
4. Copy the generated files to your Nagios conf.d directory: \\
   Example \\
   =cp aerospike/* /etc/nagios/conf.d=
5. Copy *check\_aerospike.py* and *lib/* to where your *$USER1$* macro defined
   location. \\
   =cat /etc/nagios/private/resource.cfg | grep USER1= \\
   =$USER1$=/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins= \\
   =cp check_aerospike.py lib/ /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/= \\
   =chown -R root:root /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/{check_aerospike.py,lib/}= \\
   =chmod ugo+x /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_aerospike.py=
 6. Finally restart Nagios \\
    =/etc/init.d/nagios restart=
* Aerospike Nagios Bootstrap Utility
The bootstrap utility is named *asnagios.py* it accepts two parameters:
- Required: =-c <Path to config file>= sample config provided at \\
  *configs/config.yml*
- Optional: =-o <Output Directory>= default *aerospike/*
* Aerospike Nagios Plugin
See *check\_aerospike.py*, this is the file that Nagios will schedule to perform
queries against aerospike. Other than copying it to the appropriate location,
you are not required to interact with it.
